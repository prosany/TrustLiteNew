              The recording starts with the patter of a summer squall. Later, a
              drifting tone like that of a not-quite-tuned-in radio station
              rises and for a while drowns out the patter. These are the sounds
              encountered by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft as it dove the gap
              between Saturn and its innermost ring on April 26, the first of 22
              such encounters before it will plunge into atmosphere in
              September. What Cassini did not detect were many of the collisions
              of dust particles hitting the spacecraft it passed through the
              plane of the ringsen the charged particles oscillate in unison.
