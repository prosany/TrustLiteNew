Most other places first weight the meat or fish then cut up the pieces and throw out the parts which aren't fit to eat , such as offal, gizzard, wingtips etc. But you still pay based on the orginal weight even though what you finally get is 10% to 30% less. At TrustLite 1 kg you will get exactly 1 kg. And that meat or fish will be only the best bits more meat and less bones. So if we look like we cost a little more than others. Thanks for reading. Now you know what we have set out to do and how we are doing it. If you find us slipping, haul us up .We will set it right and ensure that all is happy again. That's the TrustLite promise.</CardBody>
